        <h1>Apps</h1>
        <p>
            An app, which is short for "application," is a type of software that can be installed and run on a computer, tablet, smartphone or other electronic devices. An app most frequently refers to a mobile application or a piece of software that is installed and used on a computer. Most apps have a specific and narrow function.

        For example, a food delivery app might only be designed for users to get food from local restaurants delivered and can't be used for anything else, such as grocery shopping or making restaurant reservations. There are currently millions of apps available in various categories like business, productivity, shopping and scheduling.

        Apps can be especially important to business owners and businesses for several reasons, including that they:

        Can help business owners quickly deploy software that helps the company run more efficiently
        Are more cost-effective than other forms of software
        Can extend the reach of a business
        Can increase the productivity of a company
        Enable employees to perform business functions outside of the office
        Provide a number of services for businesses, including accounting, inventory management and CRM software
